### Statement

### Solution

Let's say the sum of the componenets are $s_1, s_2,\dots , s_k$. It must satisfy that $s_1=s_2=\dots =s_k$ becuase otherwise we would greedily take the maximum $s_i$. 

To find the maximum weight of a component rooted at $i$, we have

$$
\texttt{dp}[i] = a_i + \sum_{j\in C_i} \max(0, \texttt{dp}[j])
$$

Now, we can greedily find the components that have equal sum. Here, greedily choose vertex $i$ with the largest pre-order index. Then, we want to remove the subtree, so we set $\texttt{dp}[i]$ to $0$. This can be done with an extra DFS. The time complexity is $\mathcal O(N)$.
