### Statement 

[https://codeforces.com/contest/343/problem/E](https://codeforces.com/contest/343/problem/E)

### Solution

First, build a Gomory-Hu tree on the graph. Now, the minimum cut between $u$ and $v$ is equal to the minimum weight on the path from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$.

Now, we just need to construct an optimal permutation. Consider splitting the tree by the smallest edge $(u, v, w)$. Since we are trying to maximize the answer, it is never optimal to go through this edge more than once. Therefore, the permutation should process all vertices on one side before processing the other.

The time complexity is $\mathcal O(\min(C\cdot (N+M), N^2\cdot M) + N^2)$.
