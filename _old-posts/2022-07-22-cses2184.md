### Statement 

[Problem Link](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2184)

### Solution

Try to solve [this](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2183) first. By the greedy, we add elements from small to large and check if their sum exceeds the next element in a range $[l, r]$. We can maintain this with a persistent segtree. Then, we can just simulate this because the sum alwyas doubles.

The time complexity is $\mathcal O(N\log N + Q\log^2 N)$.
