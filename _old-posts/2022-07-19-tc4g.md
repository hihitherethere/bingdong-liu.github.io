### Solution

Let's solve the $q, \sum k\leq 500$ case. We can use FFT to find the coefficients of the products of the polynomials. Although we can just check if the forward and backward coefficients are the same, we can also build a reverse polynomial and multiply those. Now, we just need to check if these polynomials are equal. 

Now, the polynomial is in the form of $a_0 + x\cdot a_1 + x^2\cdot a_2 + \dots + x^d\cdot a_d$. If we want to check if two polynomials are equal, we can just plug in some random variable $x$ and check if their value is equal.

Let's check the probability of success. Let's say that we choose $k$ variables to test and a modulo of $10^9 + 7$. One variable has $\frac{1}{10^9+7}$ chance of fail per query, and $k$ variables have a $(\frac{1}{10^9+7})^k$ chance of fail. Now, if we pick several $k$, the fail probability will be extremely low.
