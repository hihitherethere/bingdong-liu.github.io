### Solution

Swapping $c_1$ and $c_2$ in a subtree only affects the inversion pair between the values in $c_1$ and $c_2$. Therefore, we can just count the number of inversions between $c_1$ and $c_2$ in both orientations. While counting, use segtree merging for a time complexity of $\mathcal O(N\log N)$.
