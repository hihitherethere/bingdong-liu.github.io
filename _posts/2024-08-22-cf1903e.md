### Statement

### Solution

Work on one-dimension first. Notice that if I move forwawrd an odd distance, then move back an odd distance, I will be an even distance away from where I started. Therefore, only total displacement matters. This is also true in two-dimensional case, as we can just consider each dimension separately. Therefore, the only thing that matters is the last point we end on. Find all points which are an odd distance away, and find all points which are an even distance away. If we are going first, remove all the odd-distanced points first, and if we are going second, remove all the even-distanced points first.
