### Solution

#### Bounds method

Think about how to construct a tree such that it is optimal for a monster to be removed at time $i$. This takes an exponential number of other monsters to achieve, as you need to surround this monster with monsters that should be removed at time $1$ through $i$ and it recursively grows, therefore, the last monster will be removed at time $\log_2 n$ or before.

$$
\texttt{dp}[i][j] = a_i \cdot j + \sum_{j\in C_i} \min_{k=1}^{\log_2 n}(\texttt{dp}[j][k])
$$

#### Other method

The latest possible time a monster is killed is $\texttt{degree} + 1$. For each monster, store an array $a$ of length $\texttt{degree} + 1$ where $a_i$ is the minimum damage dealt for the monster to die at time $a_i$.
