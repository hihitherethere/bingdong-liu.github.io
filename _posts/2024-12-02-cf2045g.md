### Statement 

[Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/2045/problem/G)

### Solution

If $X=1$, then the answer is $h_f-h_i$.

Consider $2$x$2$ squares. The difference between two cells must be the same as the difference between the opposite two cells or else you can gain negative penalty from one cycle and the grid would be $\text{INVALID}$.

Otherwise, it does not matter the path you take to your destination, as any path will have the same penalty or else you could make a negative infinity loop. Keep the penalty needed to go from cell $(x,y)$ to $(0,0)$, then to get your answer find the penalty to go from starting cell to $(0,0)$, then add the penalty to go from $(0,0)$ to your final cell.
