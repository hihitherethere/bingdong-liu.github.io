### Statement 

[Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/2002/problem/D2)

### Solution

Find the range in the permutation that the parent of each node can be in. This can be calculated using the sizes of the subtrees of each node, which can be calculated from a simple dfs. For each swap, update the range of the swapped nodes, and recheck both nodes and the parents of the nodes to see if they changed status. After each update, check if there are no nodes that violate their range.

#### TLE

Use unordered_map instead of ordered map
