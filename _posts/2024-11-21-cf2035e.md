### Statement 

[Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/2035/problem/E)

### Solution

I will either attack at most $\sqrt{z}$ times for small $k$, or increase at most $\sqrt{z}$ times for large $k$. We can binary search the minimum number of increases to kill the monsters in a certain number of attacks, and we can math out the minimum number of attacks to kill the monsters in a certain number of increases, as we always want to increase before we attack. The answer is the minimum achieved from both of these cases.
