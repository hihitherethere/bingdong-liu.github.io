### Statement

### Solution

The idea is that after your inversion count is higher than any number in the array, adding the inversion count will increase the inversion count or keep it the same, so the new inversion count will be greater than or equal to the previous inversion count.

The only way to keep the inversion count the same is if we put the inversion count at the end of the array, and putting it anywhere else will increase the inversion count. When adding an inversion count, there is a section of the array where putting the count in each spot will increase the count by a different amount, and the end of the array, where all the elements equal the current inversion count.

The only way two series of operations achieve the same array is if they put the inversion count at the end of the array in different ways, so we will consider there to be one way of putting inversion count at the end of the array.

Let $\text{dp}[i]$ be the number of arrays of length $i$ such that the ending number is not the current inversion count.
$$
\text{dp}[i] = \sum_{j=0}^{i-1}\text{dp}[j]\cdot j
$$
Since $i$ iterates from $0$ to $n$ in that order, we can do transitions in $O(n)$ by keeping a running sum. Some casework is required for the beginning array, but that isn't too hard.
