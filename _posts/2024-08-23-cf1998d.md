### Statement 

[Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/1998/problem/D)

### Solution

If Elsie is to beat Bessie, she must take an alternate bridge that puts her at least one island ahead of Bessie. We consider which bridges Elsie can use to win. If she wants to win using bridge $i$, that means island $u_i$ cannot be sunk and Bessie is at $v_i-1$ or before after Elsie crosses the bridge. Therefore, Bessie must start at $u_i+1$ or later, and must not reach $v_i$ before Elsie does.

Run a dijkstra to find the minimum time Elsie needs to reach island $i$ if no islands are sunk. Let this value be $\texttt{dist}[i]$. For bridge $i$, Bessie loses if she starts between $u_i+1$ and $v_i-\texttt{dist}[i]-1$. We can maintain the spots Bessie loses using a difference array or a range-update segtree.
